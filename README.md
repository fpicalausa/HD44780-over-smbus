# HD44780-over-smbus
A python library to drive a HD44780 over SMBus

See [this blog post](https://fpicalausa.github.io/2019/07/14/Programming-a-1602-lcd-over-i2c-on-a-pi.html)
to understand how this library works. 

Note that this library is just a proof of concept of how to interface with a 
HD44780 through a i2c backpack. It may or may not work in other environments.
